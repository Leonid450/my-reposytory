              'Eras' tour movie etiquette: How to enjoy the Taylor Swift concert
              film (the right way)
            </h2>
            <p>
              This weekend, cinemas will become holy ground for fans of Taylor
              Swift, whose cross-country Eras Tour enchanted millions. Now, the
              musical mastermind is staging a big-screen takeover with her
              concert movie “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which is all but
              assured to win the weekend with a mind-blowing $100 million-plus
              opening. Since the first U.S. leg of the tour ended in August,
              Swift has stayed in the headlines, thanks in part to her MTV VMAs
              sweep, her forthcoming "1989" album rerelease and her rumored
              romance with NFL player Travis Kelce.
