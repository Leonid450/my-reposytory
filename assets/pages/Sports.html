              Cowboys star Micah Parsons not convinced 49ers 'are at a higher
              level than us'
            </h2>
            <p>
              For any casual football fan, there was no mistaking which team was
              better on Sunday night.
            </p>
            <p>
              The unbeaten San Francisco 49ers ran roughshod over the Dallas
              Cowboys in a 42-10 blowout behind four touchdown passes from
              quarterback Brock Purdy and four forced turnovers from the
              defense. The Niners dominated the stat sheet as well, racking up
              421 yards of total offense to the Cowboys' 197. Yet Cowboys
              defensive end Micah Parsons was not convinced by what more than
              71,000 in attendance witnessed Sunday at Levi's Stadium.

              'Have to take some swings': Amazon breaking from status quo for
              'Thursday Night Football'
            </h2>
            <p>
              Spoon Daftary apologized into his headset for a slightly rushed
              segment, but the clock was already ticking on this commercial
              break. "Just go with the flow," the "Thursday Night Football"
              senior coordinating producer ordered from the command truck at
              FedEx Field, not long after the Chicago Bears defeated the
              Washington Commanders. "Everyone have fun here." That’s usually
              not an issue for the traveling studio crew of Richard Sherman,
              Andrew Whitworth, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Tony Gonzalez and host
              Charissa Thompson – the people Daftary is instructing from the
              truck. They were about to play a game, he said, as celebrity chef
              David Chang rejoined the set. It’s a simple premise. Producers
              from the truck will put up a name on the screen. The panel must
              answer whether that person played in the NFL or is a United States
              Congressperson – "On the Hill" or "On the Field" – all while
              chowing down on spicy chicken sandwiches from Chang’s restaurant.
